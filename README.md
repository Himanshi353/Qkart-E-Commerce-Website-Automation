<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This project focuses on automating test cases for <strong><a href="https://crio-qkart-frontend-qa.vercel.app/">QKart</a></strong>, an e-commerce platform similar to Flipkart. The automation framework was built using <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Selenium</strong>, and <strong>TestNG</strong>. Throughout the project, several tasks were completed to improve the reliability and maintainability of the test code.</p>
<h2>Key Accomplishments:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Debugged and fixed failing test cases using <strong>log statements</strong>.</li>
<li>Automated test scenarios using <strong>Selenium</strong>, with proper use of implicit and explicit waits to avoid synchronization issues.</li>
<li>Improved the reliability of tests by using <strong>XPath</strong> for dynamic locators.</li>
<li>Migrated the test code to the <strong>TestNG framework</strong> and implemented <strong>data-driven testing</strong> with <strong>Apache POI</strong>.</li>
<li>Modularized test code for better maintainability and debugging.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope of Work:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modularization &amp; Debugging</strong>: Refactored test code for readability and eliminated code duplication. Debugged and resolved issues using IDE breakpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Test Automation</strong>: Automated manual test cases for key features like product search, cart management, and session persistence. Log statements were added to improve debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong>: Applied implicit and explicit waits to enhance test stability and avoid flakiness in automation scripts.</li>
<li><strong>TestNG Integration</strong>: Migrated the test code to <strong>TestNG</strong>, enabling grouping, prioritization, and parameterization of tests. Test listeners were used to take screenshots on various events, enhancing test reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills Used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java, Selenium, XPath, TestNG, Apache POI, Log Statements, Implicit and Explicit Waits, TestNG Listeners, Modularization</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Structure:</h2>
<p>The project follows the <strong>TestNG</strong> framework and is structured based on the <strong>Page Object Model (POM)</strong>. Each page in the QKart application is represented as a class, with actions performed on the pages encapsulated in methods, ensuring the test code is scalable and easy to maintain.</p>
<h2>Key Technologies and Tools:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Java</strong></li>
<li><strong>Selenium</strong></li>
<li><strong>TestNG</strong></li>
<li><strong>Apache POI</strong> for data-driven testing</li>
<li><strong>Log Statements</strong> for debugging</li>
<li><strong>Page Object Model (POM)</strong></li>
<li><strong>XPath</strong> for dynamic locators</li>
<li><strong>Extent Reports</strong> for generating custom test reports</li>
</ul>
